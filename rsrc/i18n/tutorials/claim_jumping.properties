m.welcome_title = Jumpin' Claims!
m.welcome = Howdy pardner! Let's jaw about Claim Jumpin' fer a bit. Every \
  time you play a game in Bang! Howdy, you'll be playin' one of the numerous \
  different scenarios. Claim Jumpin' is one of them thar scenarios and we're \
  going to explain how it works.

m.claim_intro = This here's a claim. This is where ya keep yer gold nuggets. \
  When the game starts, you'll have two nuggets already in yer claim.\n \nEach \
  of those nuggets is worth 50 points. Take a look down below at yer score and \
  notice that ya got 100 points fer these two nuggets.

m.nugget_intro = This here's a gold nugget. Sometimes nuggets are just lyin' \
  around on the board waitin' fer some lucky prospector to come pick 'em up. \
  Let's give that a try.

m.pick_up_nugget_title = Pickin' Up Nuggets
m.pick_up_nugget = Move yer gunslinger to the same square as the nugget and \
  yer gunslinger will pick it up.

m.got_nugget = Nice work! Now you got to get that nugget back to yer claim \
  without gettin' all shot up by yer opponent. If a unit carryin' a nugget \
  dies, they'll drop the nugget onto the board nearby.\n \nFor now just move \
  yer gunslinger on over to a square next to yer claim to deposit that nugget \
  fer safe keepin'.

m.deposited_nugget = Perfecto! Notice that yer score went up by 50 points! \
  As long as that nugget is in yer claim, you'll get the points fer it, but \
  if yer opponent steals it back before the game ends, you'll lose them \
  points quicker than a cowpoke after a stray dogie.\n \nSpeakin' of that, \
  let's talk about stealin' nuggets from yer opponent's claim.

m.pick_up_nugget_title = Stealin' Nuggets
m.stealin_nuggets = This here's yer opponent's claim. If ya land yer unit on \
  a square next to this claim, you'll swipe a nugget from yer opponent.\n \n\
  Let's give it a try. Walk yer gunslinger on over there and get some of that \
  shiny gold!

m.stole_nugget = Yer a real pro! Notice that yer opponent's score dropped by \
  50 points. That's a dang shame!\n \nHowever, ya got to get that nugget \
  back to yer own claim before you'll get any points fer it. A nugget out in \
  the field is about as worthless as a wagon with no wheels. It's got to be \
  in yer claim to score!\n \nHead back over and deposit that nugget lickety \
  split.

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = Now ya got the hang of it pardner! There ain't much more to tell \
  'cept that in a real game yer gonna have ta duke it out against some other \
  cowpokes who'll be aimin' ta steal yer nuggets.\n \nYou'll have to work out \
  a strategy to protect yer claim and get out there and scoop up some o' them \
  nuggets. No doubt you'll do a fine job.
