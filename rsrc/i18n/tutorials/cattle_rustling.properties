m.welcome_title = Rustlin' Cattle!
m.welcome = Howdy pardner! We're gonna tell ya all about @=b(Cattle Rustlin'), \
  one of the scenarios in this here game. But before we do that, we need to \
  jabber a bit about yer @=b(Big Shot) units.

m.bigshot_intro_title = Big Shots
m.bigshot_intro = This here's yer @=b(Big Shot) unit. @=b(Big Shots) are \
  important because they are more powerful than normal units and some of \
  them have special powers.\n \n\
  In @=b(Cattle Rustlin') yer @=b(Big Shot) is extra important because they're \
  the only unit on yer team that can brand cattle, and brandin' cattle is \
  how ya score points.

m.cattle_intro_title = Brandin' Cattle
m.cattle_intro = This here's a head o' @=b(Cattle). A majestic creature, don't \
  ya reckon? However, she'd be all the more majestic if she was branded as \
  a member of yer herd.\n \n\
  Move yer @=b(Big Shot) to one of the squares next to the cattle to brand 'er.

m.cattle_scoring = Nice work! Yer a natural with that iron. Notice that the \
  cow is now marked with yer team color and down yonder on the @=b(Player \
  Status View) you got yerself a cool fifty points.

m.cattle_rebranding = However, ya can't just rest on yer laurels because yer \
  opponent can mosey on over and erase yer brand and replace it with one of \
  their own. This feller looks poised and ready to do just that!

m.cattle_rerebranding = That feller is downright careless with his branding \
  iron. What's more, ya lost yer 50 points! Not to worry though, you can just \
  pull the same trick right back.\n \n\
  Track that heifer down with yer @=b(Big Shot) and rebrand 'er as one of yer \
  rightful own.

m.timer_title = Time's a Wastin'
m.timer = Yer a true rope and ringer. Now take a gander in the upper \
  left corner where you'll see a fancy steam gauge. That thar gauge lets ya \
  know how much time ya got left before the round ends.

m.winner =  The cowpoke with the most points at the end of the round is the \
  big winner. Don't let down yer guard if yer not in first place though. \
  Ya earn more scrip fer finishin' second than third and more fer third than \
  fourth.\n \n\
  Scrip is used to buy supplies at the @=b(General Store), so yer gonna want \
  to get yer hands on that fer sure.

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = There ain't much more to tell 'cept that in a real game yer gonna \
  have ta go iron to iron against other cowpokes who'll be aimin' ta steal yer \
  cattle.\n \n\
  You'll have to work out a strategy to protect yer herd and get out there \
  and brand the strays. No doubt you'll do a fine job.
