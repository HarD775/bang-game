m.welcome_title = Bang! Howdy Parnder
m.welcome = Welcome back! This here tutorial will learn ya about Bonuses \
  and Cards and a bit more about the game interfaces.\n \n\
  Click this here window and let's get along like little dogies.

m.shoot_gunslinger_title = Gettin' Bonuses
m.shoot_gunslinger = Looks like we got a gunfight on our hands.\n \n\
  That thar gunslinger is aimin' to gun you down. Be quick on the draw \
  and fire off a shot at 'em before they start a gunnin'.

m.took_damage = Good shootin'! But that wily gunslinger returned fire on \
  ya when ya shot 'em and now yer gunslinger has taken a bit of damage.\n \n\
  Not to worry, we've got just the thing fer that.

m.repair_intro = This here is a Health Bonus. When a unit moves to pick up \
  this bonus, they'll be returned to full health. Yee haw!\n \n\
  Click yer gunslinger and move to the spot where the bonus is sittin' to \
  pick it up.

m.show_help_title = A Little Explainin'
m.show_help = Great work. Now yer feelin' fit as a fiddle.\n \n\
  During a normal game, all sorts of different bonuses will pop up around \
  the board and you'll have to decide whether you want to mosey on over to \
  pick them up. Until you know all them bonuses like the back of yer hand, \
  there's an easy way to find out what they do.\n \n\
  Hold down the 'Control' key and move the mouse over anything in the \
  game and a help window will pop up. Try it on yer Gunslinger.

m.ramblin_intro = That's the ticket pardner. Now use it to learn about this \
  here Ramblin' Bonus.\n \nIt looks purdy useful, don't ya reckon? How about \
  you walk on over and pick it up?

m.ramblin_effect = Fine footwork. Now click on yer unit and have a gander \
  at yer expanded movement range. That'll sure come in handy.\n \n\
  Next we're going to talk about cards.

m.player_status_intro_title = Dealin' up the Cards
m.player_status_intro = Before we show ya the cards. Let's have a look at \
  these here things that we call the player status displays.\n \n\
  These show you who's playin' the game, their score, their current rank among \
  all the players and what cards they got up their sleeves.

m.card_intro = Now that we got that out of the way. Have a look at this \
  here Card Bonus.\n \n\
  When you pick up that bonus, you'll get a card that you can play at any \
  time during the game. Maybe straight away, or maybe a little later when \
  it's more strategic. Even cowpokes are no strangers to strategey.\n \n\
  Head on over and pick that feller up.

m.card_detail = Got it! Notice that the card showed up in your player \
  status display. Until ya pick up the card, ya don't know what sort of card \
  it's going to be, but cards are a good thing to have, so you'll be wantin' \
  to pick 'em up when you see 'em.\n \n\
  Check out the help on that there card. That aught to come in handy. Go \
  ahead and click on that card and let's put it to use.

m.activate_card = When you get ready to play a card, a cursor will appear \
  under the mouse that shows where your card is going to be played. Some cards \
  affect a whole area rather that just one spot, so sometimes the cursor will \
  be bigger than it is now.\n \n\
  Some cards help units, and others hurt 'em. This here's a hurtin' card, so \
  how about you move that cursor over the enemy gunslinger and put a little \
  hurt on 'em.\n \n\
  Click the left mouse button to activate the card when yer ready.

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = Bang! That showed 'em. Just like bonuses, there are all sorts of \
  cards, so be sure to take a gander at the help window when you see a new \
  one.\n \n\
  Also, you can buy cards in the General Store and start each game with up \
  to three cards from yer stash. Some cards are rarer than others, so you'll \
  just have to pick up a pack or two and see what turns up.\n \n\
  That's all fer now pardner. Thanks fer stoppin' by.
