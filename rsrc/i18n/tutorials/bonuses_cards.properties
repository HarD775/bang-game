m.welcome_title = Bang! Howdy Pardner
m.welcome = Welcome back! This here tutorial will learn ya about Bonuses \
  and Cards and a bit more about the game interfaces.\n \n\
  Click this here window and let's get along like little dogies.

m.shoot_gunslinger_title = Gettin' Bonuses
m.shoot_gunslinger = Looks like we got a gunfight on our hands.\n \n\
  That thar Gunslinger is aimin' to gun you down. Be quick on the draw \
  and fire off a shot at 'em before they start a gunnin'.

m.took_damage = Good shootin'! But that wily Gunslinger returned fire on \
  ya when ya shot 'em and now yer Gunslinger has taken a bit of damage.\n \n\
  Not to worry, we've got just the thing fer that.

m.repair_intro = This here is a @=b(Repair Bonus). When a unit moves to \
  pick up this bonus, they'll be returned to full health. Yee haw!\n \n\
  Click yer Gunslinger and move to the spot where the bonus is sittin' to \
  pick it up.

m.show_help_title = A Little Explainin'
m.show_help = Great work. Now yer feelin' fit as a fiddle. Next we'll show \
  ya how to learn about things in the game.\n \n\
  Hold down the @=b(Control key) and move the mouse over anything ya like and \
  a help window will pop up fer just about anything important.\n \n\
  Try it on yer Gunslinger then click here when yer done.

m.ramblin_intro = That's the ticket pardner. Now use the @=b(Control key) to \
  learn about this here @=b(Ramblin' Bonus).\n \nIt looks purdy useful, don't \
  ya reckon? How about you walk on over and pick it up?

m.ramblin_effect = Fine footwork. Click on yer unit and have a gander \
  at yer expanded movement range. Mighty nice!

m.right_click_clear = You can click the right mouse button (or Control-click \
  on the Mac) to clear the selection.\n \n\
  Next we're gonna talk about cards.

m.player_status_intro_title = Dealin' up the Cards
m.player_status_intro = Before we show ya the cards, have a gander down at \
  the bottom of the screen at what we call the @=b(Player Status \
  Displays).\n \n\
  These show you who's playin' the game, their score, their current rank \
  among all the players and what cards they got up their sleeves.

m.card_intro = Now that we got that out of the way. Have a look at this \
  here @=b(Card Bonus).\n \n\
  When you pick up that bonus, you'll get a card that you can play at any \
  time during the game. Head on over and pick that feller up.

m.card_detail = Got it! Notice that the card showed up in your @=b(Player \
  Status Display). Until ya pick it up, ya don't know what sort of card \
  it's going to be, but cards are a good thing to have, so you'll be wantin' \
  to pick 'em up when you see 'em.\n \n\
  Use the @=b(Control key) to read about that there card. Then go ahead and \
  click on it and let's put it to use.

m.activate_card = When you get ready to play a card, a cursor will appear \
  under the mouse that shows where your card is going to be played.\n \n\
  Move the cursor over the enemy Gunslinger and click the left mouse button \
  to activate the card.\n \n\
  Also, if you want to cancel your card selection, just click the \
  right mouse button (or Control-click on the Mac).

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = Bang! That showed 'em. Just like bonuses, there are all sorts of \
  cards, so be sure to fire up that @=b(Control key) when you see a new \
  one.

m.done2 = You can buy cards in the @=b(General Store) and start each game \
  with up to three cards from yer stash. Some cards are rarer than others, \
  so you should pick up a pack or two and see what turns up.\n \n\
  That's all fer now pardner. Thanks fer stoppin' by.
