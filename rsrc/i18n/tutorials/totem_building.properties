m.welcome_title = Totem Building
m.welcome = Howdy pardner! We're gonna explain a thing or two about \
  @=b(Totem Building), so put on yer workin' gloves and get ready to build.

m.welcome2 = As you might have already figgered, @=b(Totem Building) involves \
  buildin' @=b(Totem Poles). Every pole is built on top of a @=b(Totem Base) \
  somewhere on the board.

m.different_sizes_title = Totem Bases and Totems
m.totem_base = This here is a @=b(Totem Base). You'll build yer totem poles \
  on top of this base by carrying @=b(Totems) over to the base and poppin' \
  'em on top.

m.totem_piece = This here is a @=b(Totem). Anyone can pick it up and stick it \
  onto a @=b(Totem Pole) to score points.

m.pick_up_totem = Head on over with yer Buffalo Rider and pick up that \
  @=b(Totem).

m.got_totem = Nice work! Now run over to that @=b(Totem Base) and stick yer \
  @=b(Totem) on it and score yerself some points.

m.built_totem = That's the ticket. Notice that ya got a bunch of points fer \
  placin' yer totem on the pole.

m.different_sizes_title = Scoring
m.different_sizes = The totem you just placed was a @=b(Medium Totem). \
  We got @=b(Small Totems) and @=b(Large Totems) as well. Small ones score \
  10 points, medium score 20 and large score 30.

m.score_one = As an astute Cowpoke, yer no doubt wondering why ya have in \
  excess of 80 points when the @=b(Medium Totem) ya just placed is only worth \
  20 points.

m.score_two = Grab this here @=b(Small Totem) and we'll explain.

m.score_two_a = Good work. Now pop it on top of that same @=b(Totem Pole) \
  and keep an eye on how many points ya get.

m.score_three = This time yer score went up less, but still more than the 10 \
  points you might have expected. That's because of something that we call \
  @=b(Totem Pole Points).

m.score_four = There are two kinds of @=b(Totem Pole Points). Firstly, the \
  player that has the most @=b(Totems) on a particular pole, gets a 50 point \
  bonus.

m.score_four_a = That's why your score jumped up after ya stuck the first \
  totem on the pole. But it didn't jump up as much when you added the \
  second totem, because you already had the most totems on this pole.

m.score_five = In addition to that, everyone who has totems on a particular \
  pole gets points based on how tall the pole is.

m.score_five_a = You have totems on this pole, so you got some extra points \
  because the pole got taller. That's why you got more than just 10 points \
  when you put yer @=b(Small Totem) on the pole.

m.score_six = To maximize your @=b(Totem Pole Points), you'll have to strike \
  a good balance between having at least one totem on every pole and having \
  the most totems on some poles.

m.different_bases_title = Fighting Over Poles
m.different_bases = As I mentioned earlier, there are multiple \
  @=b(Totem Bases) on the board. Have a gander at this here pole.

m.attacking = Looks like yer opponent is abuildin' on it. Now's \
  a good time to mention that you kin attack @=b(Totem Poles).

m.attacking2 = When the top @=b(Totem) on a pole belongs to yer opponent, \
  you kin attack the pole to knock their totem off.

m.attack_totem = Ram that @=(Totem Pole) with your @=b(Buffalo Rider) and \
  show that bird that ya mean business!

m.back_up = Nice work! Notice that the @=b(Damage Indicator) below the pole \
  shows that it has taken some damage. When that gets down to zero, the top \
  @=b(Totem) will pop off.\n \n\
  First though, move your @=b(Buffalo Rider) back away from that pole so you \
  can get another good running attack.

m.attack_again = Now charge over there and knock that pesky totem right off \
  the pole!\n \n\
  If it don't come off with yer next hit, you may need one more. Remember that \
  the further away the @=b(Buffalo Rider) starts from her target the more \
  damage she does.

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = Bam! Knocked 'er clean off! Well pardner, that's all we got to say \
  about @=b(Totem Building).\n \n\
  Now that ya know how to build up @=b(Totem Poles) and knock 'em down, I \
  reckon you'll stack up just fine against yer opponents. See ya out in \
  the field!
