m.welcome_title = Totem Building
m.welcome = Welcome to the @=b(Indian Trading Post). We've got a bunch of \
  exciting new gameplay scenarios here so we best get right to explainin'. \
  The first one we're gonna talk about is called @=b(Totem Building).

m.welcome2 = As you might have already figgered, @=b(Totem Building) involves \
  buildin' @=b(Totem Poles). Every pole is built on top of a @=b(Totem Base) \
  somewhere on the board.

m.different_sizes_title = Totem Bases and Totems
m.totem_base = This here is a @=b(Totem Base). You'll build yer totem poles \
  on top of this base by carrying @=b(Totems) over to the base and poppin' \
  'em on top.

m.totem_piece = This here is a @=b(Totem). Anyone can pick it up and stick it \
  onto a @=b(Totem Pole) to score points.

m.pick_up_totem = Head on over with yer Buffalo Rider and pick up that \
  @=b(Totem).

m.got_totem = Nice work! Now run over to that @=b(Totem Base) and stick yer \
  @=b(Totem) on it and score yerself some points.

m.built_totem = That's the ticket. Notice that ya got a bunch of points fer \
  placin' yer totem on the pole. We'll explain scoring a little later, \
  but the basic idea is more totems on poles means more points.

m.different_sizes_title = Scoring
m.different_sizes = The totem you just placed was a @=b(Medium Totem). \
  We got @=b(Small Totems) and @=b(Large Totems) as well. Small ones score \
  10 points, medium score 20 and large score 30.

m.score_one = As an astute Cowpoke, yer no doubt wondering why ya have in \
  excess of 80 points when the @=b(Medium Totem) ya just placed is only worth \
  20 points.

m.score_two = Grab this here @=b(Small Totem) and stick it on the pole on \
  top of yer other totem and we'll explain.

m.score_three = This time yer score went up less, but still more than the 10 \
  points you might have expected. That's because of something that we call \
  @=b(Totem Pole Points).

m.score_four = There are two kinds of @=b(Totem Pole Points). Firstly, the \
  player that has the most @=b(Totems) on a particular pole, gets a 50 point \
  bonus.

m.score_four_a = That's why your score jumped up after ya stuck the first \
  totem on the pole. But it didn't jump up as much when you added the \
  second totem, because you already had the most totems on this pole.

m.score_five = In addition to that, everyone who has totems on a particular \
  pole gets points based on how tall the pole is.

m.score_five_a = You have totems on this pole, so you got some extra points \
  because the pole got taller. That's why you got more than just 10 points \
  when you put yer @=b(Small Totem) on the pole.

m.score_six = To maximize your @=b(Totem Pole Points), you'll have to strike \
  a good balance between having at least one totem on every pole and having \
  the most totems on some poles.

# TBD
m.different_bases_title = Fighting Over Poles
m.different_bases = Also, as I mentioned earlier, there's more than one \
  @=b(Totem Base) on the board as well. Every @=b(Totem Base) that has at \
  least one of yer @=b(Totems) on it will score points.

m.one_more = Stick that last piece on a pole!

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = Stellar! You built yerself some fine Totem Poles. I think you'll \
  stack up just fine against yer opponents.
