m.welcome_title = Warpath
m.welcome = As a brave warrior, your Big Shot can wield immense power.  Let \
  me show you how to attain that power.

m.bigshot = Right now your Big Shot is not looking all that powerful.  See that \
  big 0 over his head?  It's telling you that he's at level 0.  You'll want \
  to help him get that level up as high as possible.

m.bigshot2 = You gain experience by killing enemy units.  This experience \
  will increase the level of your Big Shot, giving them more power.

m.bigshot3 = An unsuspecting enemy unit has wandered in.  Quickly, go \
  attack that Thunderbird until it's dead.

m.level = Good work!  Your Big Shot has gained it's first level.  You get 50 \
  points for each level your Big Shot holds, so work hard to keep him at a \
  high level.  If you look at the top of the screen, you can find out what \
  powers they get for this level.

m.level1 = At level 1 your Big Shot gets a small attack and defense bonus. \
  Those will increase with each additional level.  Also, other special bonuses \
  will appear at the higher levels.  Those bonuses will show up as icons on \
  the right side of the display.

m.heal = That pesky Revolutionary has really cut you down!  Try to keep your \
  Big Shot healthy, since dying will cost him some experience and possibly \
  a level.  You better find some way to heal him.

m.heal1 = Look over there, those are some healing herbs. Those herbs will \
  return some health to your Big Shot. You can use any of your units to \
  pick up the herbs.  Go send your Buffalo Rider over there to grab them.

m.heal2 = That certainly helped your Big Shot.  You'll want to keep an eye \
  open for those healing herbs and use them when your Big Shot gets into \
  trouble.

m.dead_hero = Ouch, looks like that Revolutionary meant business.  Don't \
  worry too much though, your Big Shot will respawn almost immediately. \
  They will always show up back at your starting location.

m.dead_hero2 = See, he's back and ready for action already.  Now for the \
  rest of your units, they will always respawn around your Big Shot, so \
  they'll never be far from the action.  Be warned though, as your Big Shot \
  reaches higher levels, it will take longer and longer for your regular \
  units to respawn.

m.unit_kills = Killing opponents with your regular units will also grant \
  your Big Shot experience, just not as much.  So it's often the better \
  strategy to soften up an opponent with your rgular units, then let your \
  Big Shot swoop in for the kill.

m.unit_kills1= Let's try this out by having your Buffalo Rider attack that \
  pesky Revolutionary.

m.unit_kills2 = Now that he's hurting, finish off the Revolutionary with your \
  Big Shot to gain the most experience.

m.bigshot_death = That's the way to do it!  I should also point out that when \
  a Big Shot dies, bonuses will come flying out of their fallen body. \
  Higher level Big Shots will produce more and better bonuses for you to \
  claim.
