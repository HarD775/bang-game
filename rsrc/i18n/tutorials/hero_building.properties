m.welcome_title = Hero Building
m.welcome = Howdy, let's build some heroes

m.bigshot = Your need to send your bigshot down the warpath.  The more units \
  it kills, the more powerful they'll get.  Right now he's at 0, which gives \
  him no special abilities.

m.bigshot2 = Go kill that unit over there and see what happens.

m.level = See how your bigshot has gained a level by killing that unit. \
  Look at the top of the screen and see what bonuses they get.

m.level1 = This line further explains the wonders of the hero level HUD. \
  Also you just got 50 points for attaining that level.

m.heal = Uh oh, your bigshot's hurt, we might want to do something.

m.heal1 = Look, a floating heart shapped smiley face, go pick it up.

m.heal2 = Amazing, he's been healed!

m.dead_hero = Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to withstand that Revo. \
  As you see, bonuses fly out of a bigshot's ass when it dies.  The \
  bigshot also loses some experience, which may cause their level to go \
  down.

m.dead_hero2 = Don't worry though, your bigshot will respawn immediately. \
  Your other units will respawn next to your bigshot.  They respawn faster \
  when your bigshot is at a lower level too!

m.unit_kills = If you kill an opponent with one of your non-bigshot units \
  your bigshot will still gain experience, just not as much.

m.unit_kills1 = A good strategy is to get units close to death, but finish \
  them off with your bigshot for the most experience.
