m.welcome_title = Hero Building
m.welcome = Howdy, let's build some heroes

m.bigshot = Your need to send your bigshot down the warpath.  The more units \
  it kills, the more powerful they'll get.  Right now he's at 0, which gives \
  him no special abilities.

m.bigshot2 = Go kill that unit over there and see what happens.

m.level1 = See how your bigshot has gained a level by killing that unit. \
  Look at the top of the screen and see what bonuses they get.
