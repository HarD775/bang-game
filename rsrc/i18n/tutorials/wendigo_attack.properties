m.welcome_title = Wendigo Attack
m.welcome = Welcome to the @=b(Indian Trading Post). We've got a bunch of \
  exciting new gameplay scenarios here so we best get right to explainin'. \
  The first one we're gonna talk about is called @=b(Wendigo Attack).

m.intro = @=b(Wendigo Attack) ain't like them other scenarios you've been \
  playin'. You ain't claimin' nothin' or rustlin' nothin', yer just tryin' \
  to stay alive when the demon @=b(Wendigo) come screamin' across the board.

m.intro2 = The @=b(Wendigo) are terrifyin' creatures. They got a big gapin' \
  maw that eats up everything in their path, and their claws will rend ya \
  in two quicker'n you kin say dagnabbit.

m.stayin_alive_title = Surviving the Attack
m.stayin_alive = Lucky fer you, there's two ways to survive the \
  @=b(Wendigo Attack): by holding the @=b(Sacred Talisman) or by standin' on \
  a spot covered with an @=b(Active Petroglyph of Protection).

m.talisman = This here is the @=b(Sacred Talisman). Ride yer buffalo on over \
  there and pick it up.

m.got_talisman = Great. That unit will now be protected from the @=b(Wendigo) \
  for as long as they continue to hold the @=b(Talisman).

m.got_talisman2 = If the unit is killed, or shot by the @=b(Sharpshooter) or \
  has a @=b(Stick Up!) card played on 'em, they'll drop the @=b(Talisman) and \
  another unit can pick it up.

m.petroglyph = Those light blue squares on the ground are the \
  @=b(Active Petroglyphs). The dim circles are @=b(Inactive Petroglyphs).

m.petroglyph2 = Move your @=b(Dream Catcher) onto one of the \
  @=b(Active Petroglyphs).

m.on_petroglyphs = Excellent. Now yer @=b(Dream Catcher) is safe from the \
  @=b(Wendigo).

m.wendigo_nigh = Uh oh, the @=b(Wendigo) are comin'. You can tell they're \
  about to strike because the world goes dark and the band stops playin'.

m.wendigo_nigh2 = When the lights go out, you've got exactly four ticks to \
  get all your units to safety before the @=b(Wendigo) strike. Luckily, \
  you're already in position.

m.wendigo_passed = Phew! All your units survived. We can't say as much for \
  yer opponent's @=b(Gunslinger).

m.wendigo_passed2 = It don't matter how healthy your units are. It don't \
  even help if they're wearin' an @=b(Iron Plate). When the @=b(Wendigo) come, \
  if they ain't holdin' a @=b(Talisman) or standin' on an \
  @=b(Active Petroglyph), they're demon's dinner.

m.wendigo_scoring_title = Scoring
m.wendigo_scoring = You'll notice that you scored some points. Every unit \
  that survives a @=b(Wendigo Attack) scores 15 points regardless of whether \
  they was standin' on a @=b(Petroglyph) or holdin' the @=b(Talisman).

m.wendigo_scoring2 = However, if they was doin' @=b(both), then they get an \
 extra 25 points. So if you have the chance, be sure to move yer talisman \
 carryin' units onto petroglyphs for a higher score.

m.wendigo_switches_title = Petroglyph Switches
m.wendigo_switches = The last thing we need to tell ya about are the \
  @=b(Petroglyph Switches). As ya learned, only the @=b(Active Petroglyphs) \
  protected ya from the @=b(Wendigo).

m.wendigo_switches2 = This here is a @=b(Petroglyph Switch). If ya move one \
  of yer units onto it, the @=b(Active Petroglyphs) will become @=b(Inactive) \
  and vice-versa.

m.wendigo_switches3 = Give it a shot. Ride yer buffalo on over and trip that \
  switch.

m.switch_toggled = Shazam! Notice that all the @=b(Petroglyphs) switched \
  from @=b(Active) to @=b(Inactive) and vice-versa. Once a switch has been \
  flipped, that switch can't be flipped again until 4 ticks after yer unit \
  moves off of the switch.

m.switch_toggled2 = As you might already be thinkin', you can fool \
  yer opponents by parkin' yer units on the @=b(Inactive Petroglyphs) and \
  then flippin' the switch at the last second, right before the @=b(Wendigo) \
  come chargin' through.

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = That about wraps up our explanation of @=b(Wendigo Attack). Good \
  luck out there, and be sure to keep one foot on a petroglyph and a keen \
  eye on them switches.
