m.welcome_title = Land Grab!
m.welcome = Back again! Yer an excellent student of strategy parder. This \
  time 'round we're gonna tell ya all about the @=b(Land Grab) scenario.

m.homestead_intro_title = Homesteads
m.homestead_intro =  This here is a Homestead. These are placed at various \
  points around the board.

m.homestead_intro2 = You can tell that it's yer Homestead because the color of \
  the status circle under it matches your team color. When the game starts, \
  you'll always have one Homestead to yer name.

m.homestead_intro3 = Notice you also have 50 points down there in the \
  @=b(Player Status) display. Every Homestead you control is worth 50 points.

m.homestead_claiming = This here's an @=b(unclaimed Homestead). You kin \
  tell because the status circle under it is grey.

m.homestead_claiming2 = Anyone can claim an unclaimed Homestead by moving a \
  @=b(Big Shot) unit up next to it.

m.claim_homestead = Lucky for us, here's yer Big Shot now. Move 'em on over \
  and @=b(claim) that thar Homestead.

m.claimed = Nice job! Notice that yer score when up by another 50 points. \
  Keep this up and you'll be in first place fer sure.\n\n\
  Next we're gonna tell ya about another handy feature of these here \
  Homesteads.

m.spawning_title = Respawning
m.spawning = As you've seen in previous scenarios, when one of yer units \
  gets knocked out of the game, they ain't gone forever, they just need a \
  breather.\n\n\
  In this here scenario, when yer pieces come back into the game, they come \
  back near yer @=b(most recently claimed Homestead).

m.spawned = Here's a feller now, come to help us with the rest of this here \
  explanation.\n\n\
  Speakin' of which, let's talk about gettin' yer hands on yer opponents' \
  homesteads.

m.enemy_homestead_title = Opponent's Homesteads
m.enemy_homestead = This here is one of your opponent's homesteads. You \
  kin tell because the status circle under it is their team color.

m.enemy_homestead2 = Now that thar @=b(damage indicator) under the Homstead is \
  important. In order to take a Homestead from one of yer opponents, you \
  first got to do 100 points of damage to it to turn it back into an \
  unclaimed Homestead.

m.destroy_homestead = How about you and yer friend there go knock out that \
  red Homestead so you kin claim it fer yerself?\n\n\
  You kin target an opponent's Homestead just like ya do other units. Just \
  click one of yer own units and click them little crosshairs to take a \
  whack at the Homestead.

m.reclaim_homestead = Great work! Notice that yer opponent is now 50 points \
  the poorer. Them's the breaks.

m.reclaim_homestead2 = Now just move yer Big Shot to a tile next to the \
  Homestead and claim it. Note that ya can't clear and claim a Homestead at \
  the same time. Ya got to clear it out first, then move yer Big Shot into \
  place to claim it.

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = Now ya got the hang of it pardner! In a real game yer gonna have \
  to worry about protectin' yer existing Homesteads as well as gettin' out \
  there and claimin' new Homesteads, but that's all part of the fun now \
  ain't it?

m.done2 = Good luck out there on the range and we'll see ya next time.
