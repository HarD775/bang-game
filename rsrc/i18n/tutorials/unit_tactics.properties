m.welcome_title = Unit Tactics
m.welcome = You may have noticed by now that all units are not equal.  \
  To get the best of yer foes and come out on top of scrapes, you have to \
  use yer units wisely, both in how you attack and who you attack.

m.intro = Take for example this gang of bandits approaching our wagon train \
  lead by that Dirigible (the flying steam robot).  \
  Now, with some smarts on our part we can dispatch them no problem.  Just \
  listen close, and follow my instructions...

m.gunslinger_title = Attack Penalty
m.gunslinger = First, let's send out our gunslinger.  Click on her and I'll show \
  you somethin' that you should pay attention to.

m.gunslinger2 = You'll notice that the crosshairs over the Dirigible has a \
  DOWN ARROW in the upper left.  This means that your unit has an ATTACK PENALTY \
  against this enemy unit.  Or in plain english yer attack is not very effective \
  against this unit.

m.gunslinger3 = Let's attack the Dirigible anyway, just to see what happens.  \
  Go ahead and click on the Dirigible to shoot it up.

m.gunslinger4 = Yep, that only did 10 measly damage points... it'd take a while \
  to take that flyer down at that rate.  Gunslingers are great against human units, \
  but have an ATTACK PENALTY against steam robots such as this Dirigible.

m.codger_title = Attack Bonus
m.codger = Now let me get in there and show you a thing or two.  The Codger, \
  yers truely, has an ATTACK BONUS against flying units such as that there \
  Dirigible.\n \n\
  Now click on yer Codger unit. 

m.codger2 = Notice this time that there is an UP ARROW by the crosshairs.  This \
  means that yer unit has an ATTACK BONUS, or plainly, will do more damage against \
  this enemy unit.

m.codger3 = Now go ahead and shoot that Dirigible with yer Codger unit!

m.codger4 = BANG!  That took it clean out o' the sky -- much better than the 10 \
  damage that yer Gunslinger did.  However, that Dirigible doesn't take kindly to \
  being shot down and will come crashing down on enemy units, ouch.

m.get_repair_title = Fightin' Scrapes
m.get_repair = Quick, get that repair bonus with your damaged unit!

m.barrage = Wow, I think we made the other bandit angry!  That artillery is a \
  tough foe.  Notice how it can lob shells from a safe distance away for 50 \
  Damage Points.

m.barrage2 = Ok, stop noticing and start reacting!  You've lost yer Gunslinger \
  to Artillery fire, so it's up to your Codger unit to take 'im out.

m.full_attack_title = Varying Damage
m.full_attack = Now, let's see how he likes it.  Shoot the Artillery with your \
  Codger!

m.full_attack2 = Great!  That really had some punch with 65 Damage Points!  \

m.artillery = Zooks!  He's got some fight in him left yet...  Now I've taken \
  25 Damage Points.  Notice that the artillery did less damage after it was \
  damaged itself.  Units do full damage when they have full health, and less \
  and less damage as they lose health.

m.artillery2 = That's why getting the first attack is often key in winning \
  confrontations.  Speakin' of which, click on yer Codger unit and let's win \
  this one.

m.artillery3 = I won't do 65 Damage this next time, but you can see from the \
  SKULL CROSSHAIRS that my next shot will kill the enemy unit that I'm targetting, \
  also good for strategizing who to shoot.  Shoot the Artillery again!

m.done = Blammo!  That takes care of those would be robbers.  To learn more about \
  the ATTACK PENALTY and ATTACK BONUS on units you can visit the Ranch, or hover \
  over your units in inventories or menus.

m.done2 = Let's see, I suppose I owe you a bit more than just my gratitude.  Onwards!
