m.welcome_title = Bang! Howdy Pardner
m.welcome = Wagons halt!  Alrighty, buckaroo.  If yer gonna be taking \
  charge o' my interests in \
  this frontier, then it's high time ya learned a bit about cards and \
  bonuses.  That ornery cowpoke blocking our way up ahead is just \
  the villain to make an example out of.\n \n\
  Click this here window and we'll get to work.

m.shoot_gunslinger_title = Gettin' Bonuses
m.shoot_gunslinger = If we send our Gunslinger at 'er, we'll have us an \
  old-fashioned gunfight.  Fastest draw wins, so fire off a round before \
  yer foe gets wise.

m.took_damage = Fast and true! But a wily Gunslinger always returns fire \
  within her range, and our own Gunslinger gal's taken some lead.\n \n\
  Not to worry, we've got just the thing fer that...

m.repair_intro = This here's a @=b(Repair Bonus). When a unit moves to \
  pick up this bonus, they'll be returned to full health.\n \n\
  Click yer Gunslinger and move onto that bonus.

m.show_help_title = A Little Explainin'
m.show_help = Now she's at full health again! \
  When ya see a bonus (or anything fer that matter) and ya don't know what \
  it does, just hold down the @=b(Control key) and move yer mouse over it. \
  That'll give you a handy readout on anything of importance.  Try it out \
  on our Gunslinger.

m.ramblin_intro = Now use the @=b(Control key) to learn about \
  this here convenient @=b(Ramblin' Bonus).\n \n\
  Let's send our Gunslinger to try on them fancy boots.  \
  Move yer gunslinger onto the Ramblin' Bonus now.

m.ramblin_effect = Now click on her and have a gander at that expanded \
  movement range.

m.right_click_clear = Mighty nice!  Click the right mouse button (or \
  Control-click on the Mac) to deselect the unit.\n \n\
  Now that we've stacked the deck a bit in our favor, let's have us a look \
  at who's staring us down.

m.player_status_intro_title = Dealin' up the Cards
m.player_status_intro = Down here at the bottom you'll see the @=b(Player \
  Status Displays).  These show you who's playin' the game, their score, \
  their current rank in the current game and what cards they got up their \
  sleeves.

m.card_intro = Speakin' of cards, our sleeves are lookin' a bit empty.  Handy \
  there's this here @=b(Card Bonus).\n \n\
  When you pick up that bonus, you'll get a random card that you can play at \
  any time during the game.  Send our Gunslinger to snatch that card.

m.card_detail = Got it!  Notice that the card showed up in your @=b(Player \
  Status Display). Until ya pick it up, ya don't know what sort of card \
  it's going to be, but cards are mighty handy so pick 'em up when you see 'em.

m.card_detail_2 = Use the @=b(Control key) to read about that there card. Then \
  go ahead and click on it and let's put it to use.

m.activate_card = After selecting a card to play, a cursor will appear \
  under the mouse that shows where your card is going to be played.\n \n\
  Move the cursor over the enemy Gunslinger and click the left mouse button \
  to activate the card.

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = Bang! That showed 'er.  And now the path is clear fer our wagons.  \
  If you ever want to cancel your card selection, \
  just click the right mouse button (or Control-click on the Mac). 

m.done2 = Cards ya pick up in the game can only be used in that game.  But you can \
  buy cards in the @=b(General Store) and start each game with up to three \
  cards from yer stash.  And any ya don't use in the game will return to yer \
  deck for use later.

m.card_gift = Some cards are rarer and more powerful than others, so you \
  should pick up a pack or two and see what turns up.\n \n\
  Matter o'fact, take a few with you until we get to town.  But once there, \
  be sure to pick up a pack at the General Store.  Wagons ho!
