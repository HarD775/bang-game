m.welcome_title = Forest Guardians
m.welcome = The final scenario in Indian Trading Post is called \
  @=b(Forest Guardians). Listen up and we'll explain what it means to guard \
  a forest and how ya go about doin' it.

m.intro = The first thing you need to know about @=b(Forest Guardians) is that \
  it's a cooperative scenario. Instead of competin' against the cowpokes yer \
  playin' with, you all cooperate to grow and protect trees in the forest.

m.tree_bed = Let's start with growin' trees. This here is a @=b(Tree Bed). \
  With a little care and attention, it will grow into a majestic \
  @=b(Elder Tree).

m.move_grow = The way you help a tree to grow is to park a unit next to it. \
  Move yer @=b(Buffalo Rider) over next to that @=b(Tree Bed) and watch it \
  start to sprout up.

m.growth_phases1_title = Phases of Growth
m.growth_phases1 = Notice that the @=b(Damage Indicator) at the bottom of \
  the tree is slowly filling in. When it fills in completely, the tree will \
  progress to the next @=b(Phase of Growth).

m.growth_phases2 = As the tree proceeds from 0 to 100 health, it proceeds \
  through each @=b(Phase): @=b(Tree Bed) to @=b(Sapling) to @=b(Mature Tree) \
  and finally to @=b(Elder Tree).

m.growth_phases3 = As you might expect, all is not roses in the forest. \
  Trees can take damage and if a tree ever drops to zero health it dies and \
  becomes a @=b(Stump) and cannot be revived.

m.logging_robots1_title = Ze Antagonistes
m.logging_robots1 = You might be wonderin' who would do harm to the trees in \
  the forest. It's the dastardly @=b(Logging Robots).

m.logging_robots2 = They won't rest until they've chopped down every tree in \
  the forest and used the wood to build @=b(Cheap Deck Furniture)!

m.logging_robots3 = There's one now! You'd better get him before he gets to \
  your tree and chops it down. Watch out for his long range \
  @=b(Buzzsaw Attack)!.

m.logging_robots4 = Phew! Good work. Those robots are tough customers. \
  Hopefully no more will show up while we're explainin' the rest of the \
  scenario. Here, have a @=b(Repair Bonus) to celebrate.

m.waves1_title = Makin' Waves
m.waves1 = Another important thing to know about @=b(Forest Guardians) is \
  that the scenario proceeds in waves. At the start of each wave, \
  @=b(Tree Beds) appear at various locations around the board.

m.waves2 = Then shortly after that, the @=b(Logging Robots) parachute in \
  and the fun begins! Your job during the wave is to get all the trees on \
  the board to the @=b(Elder Tree) phase and then destroy any \
  @=b(Logging Robots) that are left on the board.

m.waves3 = At that point the wave ends. As long as you managed to save \
  at least half of the trees on the board, you progress to the next \
  difficulty level. Higher difficulty means that more and tougher \
  @=b(Logging Robots) show up to the party.

m.more_kinds1_title = Different Robots
m.more_kinds1 = Oh, I forgot to mention, there ain't just @=b(Logging Robots). \
  There's also @=b(Locust Robots), who can leap like a gazelle and have a \
  terrifyin' @=b(Wing Blade Attack).

m.more_kinds2 = What d'ya know, there's one now! Quick, dispatch him before \
  he turns all yer hard work into sawdust.

m.more_kinds3 = Good riddance! Them @=b(Locust Robots) can be real pests. To \
  tell the truth, I've heard rumors that there are @=b(Super Logging Robots) \
  and @=b(Super Locust Robots), but I don't believe that hogwash.

m.fetishes1_title = Fetishes
m.fetishes1 = Next thing we want to talk about are what we call \
  @=b(Fetishes). No, not that kind of fetish! Go get yer dictionary and learn \
  yerself something about the English language.

m.fetishes2 = These @=b(Fetishes) grant @=b(Special Powers) to the unit that \
  is carryin' 'em during the game.

m.fetishes3 = @=b(Fetishes) work just like the @=b(Talisman) in @=b(Wendigo \
  Attack) or @=b(Nuggets) from way back in @=b(Claim Jumping). Your unit moves \
  onto 'em to pick em up and they keep carryin' 'em until the fetish is shot \
  out of their hand or they kick the bucket.

m.fetishes4 = This here is a @=b(Turtle Fetish). It causes the unit that's \
  carryin' it to take half as much damage as normal. Mighty handy! How about \
  ya walk over and pick that thing up?

m.fetishes5 = Here's a tip for ya. When yer unit is carryin' a fetish, you \
  can hold down the @=b(Control key) and hover the mouse over the unit to see \
  what kind of fetish they're carryin' and what its special powers are.

m.fetishes6 = There are three more types of fetish: the @=b(Bear Fetish), \
  the @=b(Frog Fetish) and the @=b(Fox Fetish). They'll be scattered around \
  the board when the game starts.

m.fetishes7 = When ya see 'em, do the same thing I just told ya. Hold down \
  the @=b(Control key) and move yer mouse over them to learn what sort of \
  @=b(Special Power) they grant to your unit.

m.scoring1_title = Scoring
m.scoring1 = We're almost done jawin' at ya, but before we send ya off into \
  the forests, we better explain how scorin' works in this here scenario.

m.scoring2 = As we mentioned, this is a co-op scenario, so yer all \
  workin' together to save them trees. That means the payout at the end of \
  the game depends on how everyone does, not just your performance.

m.scoring3 = If you make it through a lot of waves and save a high \
  percentage of trees then you'll get a good score and you'll all get a \
  high payout. If ya don't do so well, you get less. Simple as that.

m.scoring4 = There's one wrinkle though, to make things interesting. We do \
  keep track of who does the healin' and who does the shootin', so ya still \
  have a score at the end of the round that reflects how well you contributed \
  to the shared goal.

m.scoring5 = Based on that, if you have the highest score, you swipe a bit \
  of the payout from a player with a lower score than you. Conversely, if \
  you're at the bottom of the barrel, you give up a bit of your payout to the \
  top dog.

m.scoring6 = It ain't much, but I reckon it's incentive enough not to rest \
  on yer laurels while yer teammates do all the hard work of growin' and \
  defendin'.

m.done1_title = Finito! (finally)
m.done1 = Alrighty pardner. You made it through our long winded explanation \
  of @=b(Forest Guardians). It may be a bit on the complicated side, but \
  dang it if it ain't a whole lot of fun.

m.done2 = Don't be afraid to press @=b(T) while in the @=b(Saloon) to bring \
  up these here tutorials and review what we've told ya. This is a lot to \
  remember.

m.done3 = Now get on out there and give all these fancy new gameplay \
  scenarios a whirl!
