m.welcome_title = Land Grab!
m.welcome = Before we venture out into the Wild West looking for a homestead, \
  You'll need to know the rules of engagement in the @=b(Land Grab) scenario.  

m.homestead_intro_title = Homesteads
m.homestead_intro =  This here is a Homestead.  These are placed at various \
  points around the board.

m.homestead_intro2 = You can tell that it's yer Homestead because the color of \
  the status circle under it matches your team color.  When the game starts, \
  you'll always have one Homestead to your name.

m.homestead_intro3 = Notice you also have more than 50 points down there in \
  your @=b(Player Status) display.  Every Homestead you control is worth 50 \
  points.  In addition, holding Homesteads over time will rack up more points.

m.homestead_claiming = This here's an @=b(unclaimed Homestead). You can \
  tell because the status circle under it is grey.

m.homestead_claiming2 = Anyone can claim an unclaimed Homestead by moving a \
  @=b(Big Shot) unit up next to it.

m.claim_homestead = Let's get to it!  Move your Tactician unit on over \
  and @=b(claim) that Homestead.

m.claimed = Nice job!  Notice that your score when up by another 50 points.\n\n\
  Next, we're gonna tell you about another handy feature of these here \
  Homesteads.

m.spawning_title = Respawning
m.spawning = As you've seen in previous scenarios, when one of yer units \
  gets knocked out of the game, they ain't gone forever, they just need a \
  breather.\n\n\
  In this here scenario, when yer pieces come back into the game, they come \
  back near yer @=b(most recently claimed Homestead).

m.spawned = Here's our artillery respawning now.  He'll be a great help in \
  gettin' our hands on the opponents' homesteads.

m.enemy_homestead_title = Opponent's Homesteads
m.enemy_homestead = This here is one of your opponent's Homesteads.  You \
  can tell because the status circle under it is their team color.

m.enemy_homestead2 = Now that thar @=b(damage indicator) under the Homstead is \
  important.  In order to take a Homestead from one of yer opponents, you \
  first got to do 100 points of damage to it to turn it back into an \
  unclaimed Homestead.

m.destroy_homestead = How about using your units to go knock out that \
  red Homestead so you can claim it for yourself?\n\n\
  You can target an opponent's Homestead just like you do other units.  Just \
  click one of your own units and click the crosshairs to take a \
  whack at the Homestead.

m.lose_points = Great going!  Notice that your opponent is now 50 points \
  the poorer.  That'll help you get 1st place.

m.lost_stead_title = Defending Homesteads
m.lost_stead = Now just...  Villany!  Looks like our opponent has taken down \
  the Homestead that we claimed earlier.  Notice how we lost 50 points.\n\n\
  Send your Tactician unit to claim it back!

m.bounce =  Ha!  Notice how that artillery shell bounced off my handy-dandy \
  umbrella-rifle?  The Tactician unit cannot be hit by @=b(Range attacks) such \
  as the Artillery Unit's.

m.shotty = Yarrgh!  The Shotgunner on the other hand may not move far and may \
  have to be close to attack, but by jove that double barrel packs a mean punch!

m.takedown = We've got to get rid of that Shotgunner before he blasts anything \
  else.  Use your two units to finish him off!

m.takedown2 = Now we could get back to the buisness of taking the enemy \
  Homestead, but that Artillery is going to keep lobbing shells at our \
  Homestead in the meantime.\n\n\  
  Let's be smart and take him down first!

m.reclaim_homestead = KaPlow!!  Now, back to the buisness of claiming that \
  Homestead.  Move your Big Shot to a tile next to what used to be the enemy \
  Homestead to claim it.
 
m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = That was just a warmup.  In a real game your gonna have \
  to worry about protectin' your existing Homesteads as well as gettin' out \
  there and claimin' new Homesteads, but that's all part of the fun now \
  ain't it?

m.done2 = Remember too that your units will Respawn at the LAST Homestead that \
  you claimed, or if you have none, at your initial Spawn Location.  Well, onto \
  claimin' us some 'steads out here in the Wild West!  But first, my gratitude...
