m.welcome_title = Gold Rush
m.welcome = Howdy pardner! We're here ta explain to ya how the @=b(Gold Rush) \
  scenario works. It's a bit like @=b(Claim Jumpin') but there are some \
  differences of strategic importance. We'll point those out as we're \
  explainin'.

m.claim_intro = This here's yer @=b(Steam Tank). This is where ya stash yer \
  gold nuggets. When the game starts there will be nuggets scattered around \
  for ya ta pick up.

m.nugget_intro = This here's a gold nugget. Ya want to pick this up by landing \
  on it with any of yer units and take it back to yer Tank to score points. \
  Each nugget you get back to yer Tank is worth 50 points.

m.nugget_intro2 = Move yer gunslinger onto the nugget to pick it up.

m.got_nugget = Nice work! Now you got to get that nugget back to yer Tank \
  without gettin' all shot up by yer opponent. If a unit carryin' a nugget \
  dies, they'll drop the nugget onto the ground nearby.

m.got_nugget2 = For now just move yer gunslinger on over to a square next to \
  yer Tank to deposit that nugget fer safe keepin'.

m.deposited_nugget = Perfecto! Notice that yer score went up by 50 \
  points!

m.deposited_nugget2 = An important thing to know about @=b(Gold Rush) is that \
  ya can't steal nuggets from yer opponents' Tanks. Once ya get a nugget into \
  yer Tank it's safe and sound.

m.lodes_title = Lodes
m.lodes = Throughout the round, new nuggets will appear at certain spots \
  around the board. Keep track of where them nuggets show up because there's \
  a good chance more nuggets will show up there later.

m.lodes2 = There will always be at least one nugget in play for each player in \
  the game. Once someone gets a nugget into their Tank, a new one will show up \
  somewhere else on the board.

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = Just like in the other scenarios, the more points ya get, the higher \
  yer rank at the end of the round and the more scrip ya earn.

m.done2 = That's about all we got to say. It looks like yer ready to get out \
  there and jump, rustle and rush with the best of 'em. Good luck pardner, \
  and we'll see ya in @=b(The Saloon).
