m.welcome_title = Bang! Howdy Pardner
m.welcome = Welcome to Bang! Howdy. This here tutorial will fill ya in on \
  the basics of bein' a rootin' tootin' cowpoke. Click this here window and \
  we'll get on with the show.

m.camera_pan_title = Controllin' the Camera
m.camera_pan = First let's learn ye how to control the camera. It's mighty \
  simple, just move it around with the W, A, S and D keys. You can also use \
  the arrow keys if yer a southpaw.

m.camera_zoom = You can switch between zoom levels with the C key and you \
  can rotate with the middle mouse wheel or the Q and E keys.

m.show_unit_title = Units
m.show_unit = This here's a Gunslinger, one of the units you'll use in the game.

m.click_unit = You can select a unit by clickin' on 'em, or by pressing \
  the TAB key. The TAB key will quickly move you to any units that are \
  awaiting commands.\n \n\
  Select the Gunslinger and let's get movin'.

m.click_to_move = Good job pardner! Them little squares show you where yer unit \
  can move. Click one of 'em and let's get a move on.

m.observe_ticks = Nice work. Now have a look at them little \
  ticks down near the Gunslinger's feet.

m.move_again = Those tell ya how long ya have to wait before you can move \
  the Gunslinger again. Every few seconds one of them ticks will fill in \
  and when they're all filled in, she's ready to go!

m.move_again_2 = Wait for 'em to all fill in and then move 'er again.

m.preload_move_title = Advanced Orders
m.preload_move = Now sometimes you know what you want to do before yer unit \
  is ready to go. Fortunately, you can give advanced orders to yer unit in \
  the same way you give normal orders.

m.preload_move_2 = Any time a unit is not ready, it will simply take note of \
  your orders and execute them as soon as it can.

m.preload_move_3 = Try givin' yer Gunslinger an advanced move order. She's \
  probably ready to move already, so move her and then move her again right \
  after that.

m.examine_pending = Perfecto! Notice the little icon on the board lettin' ya \
  know where you told that unit to move. When you hover yer mouse over a unit \
  with an advance order, it will highlight its advance order icon in \
  white.

m.redo_order = By the way, you can change a unit's advance order by selectin' \
  'em and giving 'em new orders any time before they execute their current \
  orders.

m.click_to_highlight_attacks_title = Shootin' Yer Opponents
m.click_to_highlight_attacks = Now we got us some unsavory customer shown up \
  on our property. Click yer Gunslinger and take a gander at the crosshairs \
  that show up on that varmint. Those let you know that you can mosey on over \
  and shoot 'em.

m.click_to_attack = There are a couple of ways you can shoot yer \
  opponent. The simplest is to just click the unit that has crosshairs \
  over it and your unit will automatically figger out where it's gotta \
  go to shoot.

m.click_to_attack_2 = Click them crosshairs and let's show that varmit who's \
  boss!

m.move_and_attack = Nice shootin'! There's another way of shootin' that you \
  can use when yer keen to move to a particular spot and then do yer shootin'.

m.move_and_attack2 = First click yer unit, then click on the ground where \
  ya want to move, then click on the crosshairs to indicate yer target. \
  Give it a try.

m.move_double_click = That showed 'em! By the way, if ya just want to shoot \
  anyone in range, you can double click the spot where you want to move and \
  yer unit will randomly pick from the available targets.  Also, if ya don't \
  want to shoot anyone, just hold down Shift when you click to move.

m.damage_and_respawn_title = Watch Yer Health
m.damage_and_respawn = Last thing we want to jaw about is yer units' health. \
  Take a gander at the bar down at the unit's feet that we showed ya earlier.

m.damage_and_respawn2 = Yer bar is full whereas yer opponent's bar isn't \
  quite so full. That's because ya done shot 'em and they've taken some \
  damage.

m.damage_and_respawn3 = When a unit's health is completely gone they're \
  not out of the game permanently, but they do need some time to recover \
  and won't show back up for a few turns.

m.damage_and_respawn4 = On top of that, steam units leave a bit of wreckage on \
  the board which can block the way if they're knocked out in a tight spot.

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = That about wraps it up. Now ya got the hang of the basic controls. \
  Check out the rest of the tutorials to round out yer learnin'.
