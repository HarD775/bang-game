m.welcome_title = Bang! Howdy Pardner
m.welcome = Welcome to Bang! Howdy. This here tutorial will fill ya in on \
  the basics of bein' a rootin' tootin' cowpoke. Click this here window and \
  we'll get on with the show.

m.camera_title = Controllin' the Camera
m.camera = First let's learn ye how to control the camera. It's mighty \
  simple, just move it around with the W, A, S and D keys.\n \n\
  You can switch between zoom levels with the C key and you can rotate with \
  the middle mouse wheel or the Q and E keys.

m.click_unit_title = Units
m.click_unit = This here's a gunslinger, one of the units you'll use in \
  the game. When you select a unit, you'll see where that unit can move.\n \n\
  You can select a unit by clickin' on 'em, or by pressing the TAB key. \
  The TAB key will quickly move you to any units that are awaiting \
  commands.\n \n\
  Select the gunslinger and let's get movin'.

m.click_to_move = Good job pardner! Now click one of them highlighted \
  spots to move there.

m.observe_ticks_then_move = Nice work. Now have a look at them little \
  ticks down near the gunslinger's feet.\n \n\
  Those tell ya how long ya have to wait before you can move the gunslinger \
  again. Every few seconds one of them ticks will fill in and when they're \
  all filled in, she's ready to go!\n \n\
  When they're all filled in, move 'er again.

m.preload_move = Now sometimes you know what you want to do before yer unit \
  is ready to go. Fortunately, you can give advanced orders to yer unit in \
  the same way you give normal orders.\n \n\
  Any time a unit is not ready, it will simply take note of your orders and \
  execute them as soon as it can.\n \n\
  Try givin' yer gunslinger an advanced move order. She's probably ready \
  to move already, so move her and then move her again right after that.

m.examine_pending = Perfecto! Notice the little icon on the board lettin' ya \
  know where you told that unit to move. When you hover yer mouse over a unit \
  with an advance order, it will highlight its advance order icon in \
  white.\n \n\
  You can change a unit's advance order by selectin' 'em and giving 'em new \
  orders any time before they execute their orders.

m.click_to_highlight_attacks_title = Shootin' Yer Opponents
m.click_to_highlight_attacks = Now we got us some unsavory customer shown up \
  on our property.\n \n\
  Click yer gunslinger and take a gander at the crosshairs that show up on \
  that varmint. Those let you know that you can mosey on over and shoot 'em.

m.click_to_attack = There are a couple of ways you can shoot yer \
  opponent. The simplest is to just click the unit that has crosshairs \
  over it and your unit will automatically figger out where it's gotta \
  go to shoot.\n \n\Click them crosshairs and let's show that varmit who's boss!

m.move_and_attack = Nice shootin'! There's another way of shootin' that you \
  can use when yer keen to move to a particular spot and then do yer \
  shootin'. First click yer unit, then click where ya want to move, then \
  click on the crosshairs to indicate yer target.\n \n\
  Or if ya just want to shoot anyone in range, you can double click where \
  you want to move and you'll automatically shoot anyone in range, once you \
  get there.\n \n\
  Try a little movin' and shootin'.

m.damage_and_respawn_title = Watch Yer Health
m.damage_and_respawn = Yer might good with that six shooter!\n \n\
  Last thing we want to jaw about is yer units' health. Take a gander at \
  the bar down at the units feet that we showed ya earlier.\n \n\
  You may notice that yer bar is full whereas yer opponent's bar isn't \
  quite so full. That's because ya done shot 'em and they've taken some damage.

m.damage_and_respawn_2 = When a unit's health is completely gone they're \
  not out of the game permanently, but they do need some time to recover \
  and won't show back up for a few turns.\n \n\
  On top of that, steam units leave a bit of wreckage on the board which \
  can block the way if they're knocked out in a tight spot.\n \n\
  Go ahead and finish off that pesky trespasser and teach him a lesson.

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = That's all we got to say fer now pardner. Thanks fer turnin' \
  a friendly ear.
