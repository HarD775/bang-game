m.welcome_title = Rustlin' Cattle!
m.welcome = what are we doin' way over here at this abandoned ranch by the \
  river, and why am i whispering?  Ahem!  /
  Well, I 'spose it's about time to tell ya all about @=b(Cattle Rustlin'), \
  one of the scenarios in this here game.  But before we do that, we need to \
  jabber a bit about yer @=b(Big Shot) units.

m.bigshot_intro_title = Big Shots
m.bigshot_intro = This here Cavalry is a @=b(Big Shot) unit like me.  \
  @=b(Big Shots) are important because they are more powerful than normal \
  units and some of them have special powers.  I'll let him tell you 'bout \
  the rest...

m.bigshot_intro_2 = Howdy!  In @=b(Cattle Rustlin') yer @=b(Big Shot) is extra \
  important because they're the only unit on yer team that can brand cattle, \
  and brandin' cattle is how ya score points.

m.cattle_intro_title = Brandin' Cattle
m.cattle_intro = This here's a head o' @=b(Cattle).  A majestic creature, don't \
  ya reckon?  However, he'd be all the more majestic if he was branded as \
  a member of our herd -- I'm sure no one would mind!

m.cattle_intro_2 = Move yer @=b(Big Shot) to one of the squares next to the \
  cattle to brand 'im.  When you select yer @=b(Big Shot), yer moves are \
  highlighted in green instead of yellow.  That's a reminder that yer movin' yer \
  @=b(Big Shot)!

m.cattle_scoring = Nice branding!  Yer a natural with that iron.  Notice that the \
  steer is now marked with yer team color and down yonder on the @=b(Player \
  Status View) you got yerself a cool fifty points.

m.cattle_rebranding = Uh oh!  I guess this ranch aint quite so 'bandoned as we \
  figured.  Looks like he's fixin' to erase yer brand and replace it with one of \
  his own!  This feller know's then the head o' cattle would be his again!

m.cattle_rerebranding = That feller is downright careless with his branding \
  iron.  What's more, ya lost yer 50 points.  I say we shoot the varmint fer \
  messin' with what's clearly our property.  Go on, shoot 'im!

m.cattle_rerebranding_2 = See how he likes that one, huh!  Now back to rustlin', \
  you can just pull the same trick right back.  Track that bull down with yer \
  @=b(Big Shot) and rebrand 'im as one of yer rightful own.

m.timer_title = Time's a Wastin'
m.timer = Yer a true rope and ringer.  Now take a gander in the upper \
  right corner where you'll see a fancy steam gauge.  That thar gauge lets ya \
  know how much time ya got left before the round ends.

m.winner = The cowpoke with the most points at the end of the round is the \
  big winner.  Don't let down yer guard if yer not in first place though.  \
  Ya earn more scrip fer finishin' second than third and more fer third than \
  fourth.

m.winner_kill = Speakin' of winnin', how's about we get that cattle thief \
before he get's any more wise ideas about our cattle!  Shoot 'im again!

m.winner_2_title = Scrip
m.winner_2 = Scrip is used to buy supplies at the @=b(General Store), so yer \
  gonna want to get yer hands on that fer sure.  Pick up some @=b(Cards) and use \
  'em to give yer opponent a little surprise when they least expect it.

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = There ain't much more to tell 'cept that in a real game yer gonna \
  have ta go iron to iron against several other cowpokes who'll be aimin' ta \
  steal yer cattle and shoot ya t'boot.

m.done_2 = You'll have to work out a strategy to protect yer herd and get out \
  there and brand the strays.  But first, I reckon' I aught to share in the \
  bounty of this here fine cow with ya.  C'mon, let's get back to the Wagons!
