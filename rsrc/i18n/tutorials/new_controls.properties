m.welcome_title = Bang! Howdy Pardner
m.welcome = Howdy! Glad yer gonna help me, but movin' West aint no easy picnic. \
  There's danger all about, and nine times o'ten you'll be right in the thick of it. \
  So, consider this yer crash course in not gettin' plugged.  Click this here \
  window and let's begin...

m.camera_pan_title = Controllin' the Camera
m.camera_pan = I always say keep yer eyes peeled \
  fer trouble and trouble won't bother you none.  You can move the view around \
  with the W, A, S and D keys. You can also use the arrow keys if yer a \
  southpaw.

m.camera_zoom = You can switch between zoom levels with the C key and you \
  can rotate with the middle mouse wheel or the Q and E keys.  Give 'er a spin.

m.show_unit_title = Units
m.show_unit = Let's get you aquainted with yer forces.  This here's \
  a Gunslinger, one of our hands on the ranch that you'll command. \
  She's mighty sharp with a revolver, which is great against other human units.

m.click_unit = You can select a unit by clickin' on 'em, or by pressing \
  the TAB key. The TAB key will quickly move you to any units that are \
  awaiting commands.\n \n\
  Select the Gunslinger and let's get 'er  movin'.

m.click_to_move = Now you can see where she can move to by her range of \
  yellow squares.  Notice also that the one you are thinkin' about movin' \
  to highlights.  Click any yellow square and watch her hightail it.

m.observe_ticks = I can see yer no stranger to givin' orders.  This wagon \
  train may make it out West yet.  \n \n\
  Now have a look at them little blue ticks down near the Gunslinger's feet. \ 
  Watch 'em slowly add up to the whole ring.

m.move_again = Those ticks tell ya how long ya have to wait before you can \
  move the Gunslinger again.  Every few seconds one of them ticks will fill in \
  and when they're all filled in, she's ready to go!\n \n\
  Once she's set move her again back this 'a way.

m.preload_move_title = Advanced Orders
m.preload_move = Now sometimes you know what you want to do before yer unit \
  is ready to go. Fortunately, you can give advance orders to yer unit in \
  the same way you give normal orders.  If a unit ain't ready yet it can \
  still take your orders and just execute them as soon as it can.

m.preload_move2 = Try givin' our Gunslinger an advance move order. She's \
  probably ready to move already, so move her once first and then tell her \
  to move someplace else right after that.

m.examine_pending = Notice the little icon on the board lettin' ya know where \
  you told that unit to move. When you hover yer mouse over a unit with an \
  advance order, it'll highlight its advance order icon in white.

m.redo_order = By the way, you can change a unit's advance order by selectin' \
  'em and giving 'em new orders any time before they execute their current \
  orders.  You can also cancel an order entirely by selecting a unit then right clicking.

m.click_to_highlight_attacks_title = Shootin' Yer Opponents
m.click_to_highlight_attacks = Now look at that!  Some unsavory customer gone \
  shown up on our rightful property.  This is what I mean about keepin' an eye \
  out fer danger.  Let's teach 'im a lesson.\n \n\
  Click yer Gunslinger and take a gander at the crosshairs that show up on \
  that varmint. Those let you know you have moves that can bring you into firing \
  range.

m.click_to_attack = Now, there are a couple of ways you can shoot an opponent. \
  The simplest is to just click the unit that has crosshairs over it and your unit will \
  automatically figger out where it's gotta go to reach it.

m.move_and_attack = Now, there's another way to  order an attack that you can \
  use when yer keen to do yer shootin' from a particular location.

m.move_and_attack2 = First click yer unit, then click on the ground where \
  ya want 'em to move, then click on the crosshairs to indicate yer target. \
  The crosshairs will go brown if movin' there will take the unit outta range, \
  so only click a ground tile nearby yer target, where the crosshairs are \
  white. Now, make that tresspasser dance!

m.move_double_click = That showed 'em! By the way, if ya just want to shoot \
  anyone in range, you can double click the spot where you want to move and \
  yer unit will randomly pick from the available targets.

m.damage_and_respawn_title = Units' Health
m.damage_and_respawn = Last thing ye'll want to notice is yer units' health. \
  Take a gander at the bar down at the units feet that we showed ya earlier.

m.damage_and_respawn2 = You may notice that yer Gunslinger's  bar is plenty \
  full, whereas that trespasser's bar is lookin' pretty low. That'd be a \
  result of all them bullets you been sendin' his way. \n \n\
  All right, don't leave a job half done.  Finish 'im off.

m.damage_and_respawn3 = When a unit's health is completely gone they ain't out of the game \
  permanently, but they do need some time to recover and won't show back up \
  for a few turns.  On top of that, steam units leave a bit of wreckage on the \
  board which can block the way if they're knocked out in a tight spot.

m.done_title = Finito!
m.done = Well, that takes care of that pesky intruder. Good work!  Ya got \
  the hang of the basic controls.  No time fer lollygaggin', though.  Sun's \
  a-rising!  Let's get these wagons West!
