m.cavalry = Cavalry
m.cavalry_descrip = His large movement range is great fer rustlin' cattle.
m.cavalry_details = The @=b(Cavalry) is a straight shootin' Big Shot and \
  keeps his team in line. He's master of the ground, being a ground unit \
  himself and with attack and defense bonuses versus ground units.\n\n\
  His large movement range is great for scenarios that involve covering \
  a lot of territory. He's not a heavy hitter but his rifle does mid-level \
  damage and his extra firing range comes in mighty handy.
m.cavalry_power = None

m.codger = Old Codger
m.codger_descrip = He blasts his target's tick counter back to zero.
m.codger_details = The @=b(Old Codger) is a sturdy Big Shot and all around \
  ornery feller. He can shoot down a Dirigible in a single shot and he's \
  also got a bonus versus steam units. He's tough as nails to boot with \
  extra defense from both ground and air.\n\n\

  a few tricks up his sleeve. He may take a while to get across the board, \
  but his invulernability to Artillery fire and his high-powered brolly \
  shotgun make him a good choice in games where your opponents are focusing \
  on knocking out your Big Shot.
m.tactician_power = He deflects ballistic shots using his umbrella. If \
  another unit is next to him they may be hit by the deflected shot.

  units.

  take out enemy units before they get close enough to cause any trouble.\n\n\

  whatcha need and then hightail it over a hill and out of harm's way.\n\n\
  He's also great for taking out Artillery and other units that can only \
  attack targets on the ground.

m.gunslinger_descrip = She returns fire when fired upon.
m.gunslinger_details = The @=b(Gunslinger) is a good all-around ground \
  unit with medium movement and firing range and packin' a mid-sized punch. \

  for Steam units though; her six shooters ain't much good against 'em.
m.gunslinger_power = She gets a free return shot on any unit that fires on \
  her from within her range. Her return fire is always 75% of her full \
  strength regardless of her current damage level.

m.steamgunman_details = The @=b(Steam Gunman) can make his way around the \
  board with ease and packs a decent punch to boot. He's a tough customer \
  with an attack bonus versus both range and human units. You'll definitely \
  want him fer any scenario that involves carryin' things around.\n\n\
