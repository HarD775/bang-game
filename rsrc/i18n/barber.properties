  <p class="help">Once ya have more than one look, you kin tell us which looks \
  ya want ta be used fer different situations. You kin have a special look \
  that's shown off to yer opponents when ya win <b>1st Place</b> in a game. \
  You kin also have a special look that's shown on yer <b>Wanted Poster</b>. \
  And yer normal look is what folks see when yer sidled up to the bar at the \
  <b>Saloon</b> or chattin' with yer pardners.<br><br> \
