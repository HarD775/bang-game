title = Jaques Le'Trap

descrip = Jaques Le'Trap is wanted for illegally poaching forest animals, defiling totem poles, \
  chopping down sacred trees, steeling gold, and being a no-good, low-down, rotten, scoundrel \
  in general.  Stop this mad trapper now!

  your petty attempts and steal le gold!"

three.name = Totem Camp
three.pregame_quote = "Aha!  We've caught Jaques in the act of crashing a totem building contest.  \
  make sure we win this one so that we embarrass him in front of everyone!  Be careful though, it \
  seems that he's bribed another player to help him win."

four.pregame_quote = "You have fallen into my... how do you say?  Oh yes, TRAP.  Ha ha!  Now I will \
  crush you, you foolish little rh'abbit!"

  good!"
