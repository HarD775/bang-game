How to make the Mac disk image

1) Run the appropriate ant command for the build you want:

   for a normal installer with just Getdown run:

      ant devclient|client

   for the full installer run:

      ant devclient_full|client_full

2) Move the mac install directory to a mac with the same path:

scp /export/bang/projects/installers/mac
   somemac:/export/bang/projects/installers/mac

Make sure that somemac has the developer tools and is set up for Bang
Development.

3) Run the 'image' ant target to generate a disk image. The image will be
   automatically mounted on the desktop.

4) From the Finder, open the disk image and choose "Show View Options"
   from the "View" menu (command-J)

    * Select "For This Window Only" in the "View Options" panel

    * Set the background image (Hit command-shift-g in the "Open File"
      dialog, type in /Volumes/Bang Howdy/.background, select banner.png)

    * Set the icon size (96x96)

    * Resize the window and position the icon to make it look pretty. See
      how_it_should_look.jpg for an example

    * Once everything is pretty, unmount the disk image.

5) Run the 'image-seal' ant target. This will create the final, read-only,
   internet-enabled, compressed disk image at dist/bang-install.dmg

6) Ship it! Check in the bang-install.dmg. Accept the accolades of Mac users!
