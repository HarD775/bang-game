How to make the Mac disk image

1) Run the appropriate ant command for the build you want:

   for a normal installer with just Getdown run:

      ant devclient|client

   for the full installer run:

      ant devclient_full|client_full

2) Move the mac install directory to a mac with the same path:

scp /export/bang/projects/installers/mac
   somemac:/export/bang/projects/installers/mac

Make sure that somemac has the developer tools and is set up for Bang
Development.

3) Run 'ant image' ant target. This will create the final, read-only,
   internet-enabled, compressed disk image at dist/bang-install.dmg

4) Check the bang-install.dmg to make sure it's kosher. Accept the
   accolades of Mac users!
